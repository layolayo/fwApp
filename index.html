        <p>In Facilitated Writing sessions I facilitate you as you develop ideas and write content. As a facilitator I use Clean Sequences, which are sets of questions that direct attention to where it needs to go.</p>
        <p>If you prefer to self-facilitate, you can use the Clean Sequences in my ‘Dyter’ mobile app which is available in the Google PlayStore. For login details for the ‘Dyter’ app please contact <a href="mailto:richard.dyter@facilitatedwriting.com">richard.dyter@facilitatedwriting.com</a>.</p>

        <h3 class="fw-bold text-center mb-5">Excerpt from one of my articles</h3>
        <p>“Boost value-per-page and keep a reader reading” is good advice from Rob Fitzpatrick who is the author of ‘Write Useful Books’. Inspired by Rob, I’ve written Clean Sequence 476204 to help ‘us writers’ provide value in a more concentrated form.</p>
        <p>When I facilitate writing by using Clean Sequence 476204, I’m looking for the word count of an early draft to be cut by half while retaining all the value. That would mean the audience would receive twice as much value per page. </p>
        <p>Rob argues that, when the audience is disengaging from content, the problem is “nine times out of ten” low value-per-page. So using Clean Sequence 476204 could be a big deal.</p>
        <p>In order to cut out fluff and leave in the value, we need to know what ‘value’ actually is to the target audience. A useful definition is that ‘something has value in writing if it moves the audience closer to what that section promises to the audience’…  <a href="https://richarddyter.substack.com/p/use-clean-sequence-476204-to-help">[continue to read the full article]</a></p>

        <h3 class="fw-bold text-center mt-5 mb-5">Acknowledgements</h3>
        <p>The Clean Sequences that I use in ‘Facilitated Writing’ are built on the ideas of David Grove and innovations by Matthew Hudson. I also draw on ideas of Rob Fitzpatrick in his book ‘Write Useful Books: A modern approach to designing and refining recommendable nonfiction’. </p></p>
